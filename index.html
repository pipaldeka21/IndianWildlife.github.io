      India is home to a large variety of animals. It is a biodiversity hotspot
      with its various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the
      evergreen rain-forests in the south, the desert sands of the west to the
      marshy mangroves of the east. India, lying within the Indomalayan realm,
      is home to about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of bird, 6.2% of
      reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species. India's forest lands
      nurture about 500 species of mammals and 2000+ bird species. This richness
      of Indian wildlife has been celebrated since time immemorial. Four of
      India’s national symbols consist India’s mammals.

      three of the world’s 36 biodiversity hotspots – the Western Ghats, the
      Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot. It is one of the seventeen
      megadiverse countries. The country has seven Natural World Heritage sites,
      eleven Biosphere Reserves in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves and
      thirty seven Ramsar Wetlands.

      In India one can find almost 350 mammal species, nearly 2200 bird species
      and more than 32,000 species of insects. Numerous species of fish,
      amphibians and reptiles are also available in different parts of India. A
      vast part of Indian land is covered with forests. There are lots of
      wildlife reserves in India.
