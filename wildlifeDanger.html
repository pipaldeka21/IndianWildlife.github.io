      The major dangers to our wildlife includes the following:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 50px">
      <li>Animal trafficking.</li>
      <li>Poaching.</li>
      <li>Natural Calamity like flood, earthquake, tsunami etc.</li>
      <li>Forest land inhabited by humans.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Animal trafficking :</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; India is among the top 20
      countries for the illegal wildlife trade and its fast expanding airport
      sector is often used by wildlife traffickers to smuggle high-end,
      high-value species and products. Wildlife trade poses the second-biggest
      direct threat to the survival of species after habitat destruction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Poaching :</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poaching of tigers and
      leopards are very high in numbers. Even though poaching of wild animals
      and the trade of animal parts is banned in India but there are a number of
      majestic animals being poached to bring the best out of the animal
      products like ivory, horn, teeth, skin and bone.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Natural Calamity :</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; India is a land of
      megabiodiversity. It has a variety of wildlife througout the country.
      Natural calamities affect the wildlife of India in various ways. Around
      100s of animals get killed by flood in India. Tsunami is also responsible
      for the death of many coastal animals. There must be good emergency relief
      system for animals in order to reduce the death of animals in India.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Forest land inhabited by humans :</h3>
    <p>
