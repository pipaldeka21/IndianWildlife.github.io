      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once home to some of the
      world’s densest forests, India’s vast green cover still constitutes close
      to 20% of the country’s total area (about 64 million hectares). These
      forested hinterlands are home to over 89 National Parks, scores of
      bio-reserves and over 400 sanctuaries. The parks provide a desperately
      needed refuge to a host of animals spanning the entire spectrum of the
      food chain right from big cats like lions, tigers and leopards, reptiles
      like rhinos, pythons and crocodiles, to innumerable deer species, and the
      emblematic Asian elephant. While some parks like the Corbett National Park
      in Uttarakhand, Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan, and the Rhino
      preserve of Kaziranga in Assam are world-famous, there are an infinite
      number of smaller wildlife havens which which is home to a lot of rare
      species of wildlife.

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The national parks of
      India are treasure troves for nature lovers, containing a wide range of
      geographical and climatic diversity. Within India’s boundaries you can
      find the soaring Himalayan mountain range, the lush rainforests of the
      Western Ghats, the arid Thar Desert, and 4,600 miles of coastline. Though
      the forest cover in India is only at about 22%, the subcontinent is home
      to about 10% of the world’s species.
